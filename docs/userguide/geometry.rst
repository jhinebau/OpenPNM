Pore and Throat Geometry
###############################################################################
In OpenPNM the pore and throat geometry are defined separately from the **Network** topology.  In other words, creating a network simply places pores at certain coordinates and connects them in a certain pattern.  It is the job of the **Geometry** object(s) to calculate the physical properties of the pores and throats (i.e. sizes, volumes, lengths, etc), based on a given pore or throat model (i.e. sphere, cuboid, cylinder, etc).  

.. note:: 

	Fluid, Geometry and Physics modules are designed to function identically, so once you're familiar with the usage of one then all the others should be similar.  

===============================================================================
What is a Geometry Object?
===============================================================================

**Geometry** objects have one main function in OpenPNM.  They contain the models the user wishes to use to calculate pore and throat properties, such as diameter and volume.  

===============================================================================
Creating a Geometry Object
===============================================================================
The most general way to generate a **Geometry** object is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

	pn = OpenPNM.Network.TestNet()  # This generates a 5x5x5 cubic network for testing purposes
	temp_ps = pn.pores()
	temp_ts = pn.throats()
	geom = OpenPNM.Geometry.GenericNetwork(network=pn, pores=temp_ps, throats = temp_ts, name='geom_1')
	
There are 4 arguments sent to ``GenericGeometry`` here.  Firstly, the **Geometry** object is associated with a **Network** via ``network=pn``.  This gives the **Geometry** object access to the network topology, and allows the **Geometry** to register itself with the network.  The ``pores`` and ``throats`` arguments tell the **Geometry** where in the overall network it is defined. Finally, each **Geometry** object (and all objects in OpenPNM) must be given a unique name (``name='geom_1'``).  This makes is possible for a human reader to differentiate between multiple different **Geometry** objects by simply checking their ``name`` attribute.  

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Adding Models to a Geometry
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Once a **Geometry** object has been instantiated, the next step is to add methods to the object that calculate the appropriate pore and throat properties.  The ``GenericGeometry`` class inherits the ``add_model` function for this purpose.  It is typical to assign a random seed to each pore in the network which is subsequently used to calculate pore diameters from a statistical distribution.  The **Geometry** module comes with a submodule called **pore_seed** that contains several methods that can be used.  The desired method is added to the **Geometry** object as follows:

.. code-block:: python

	geom.add_method(prop='pore_seed',method='random')
	
This command looks into the **pore_seed** submodule and finds a method named ``random``.  It attaches this method to itself under the attribute name ``pore_seed`` because the default is to use the name of ``prop``.  The **Geometry** object now knows how to generate pore seed values when they are needed.  

In the above case the seeds generated each time the code is run will differ since the state of the random number generator was not specified.  Many methods, including the ``random`` method in **pore_seed** accept or require additional parameters. In the case of ``random`` it is possible to send a seed value which initializes Scipy's random number generator to the specified state as follows:

.. code::

	geom.add_method(prop='pore_seed',method='random',seed=10)

Attaching the ``pore_seed`` method to the **Geometry** object in this way will always result in the same random numbers being placed inside each pore since the generator will always be initiated with to the same starting state.  The above procedure is repeated for all the desired methods.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Generating or Regenerating Geometry Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Once the **Geometry** object has been built and contains all the desired property models it is necessary to actually run all these methods to calculate their results.   When the time comes to generate the pore and throat size data (or regenerate it) one *can* manually run each method as:

.. code-block:: python

	geom.pore_seed()

If a large number of method have been added and/or they have custom names this can be an annoying task.  To avoid this, each time ``add_method`` is called, it appends the 'propname' to a private list of attached methods.  The ``GenericGeometry`` class includes a method called ``regenerate`` which simply scans through this list and calls each method.  The items in the list are stored in the order they were called in, and the methods are invoked in that order.  It is possible to regenerate only some methods by sending their attribute name ('propname') to the ``regenerate`` method as a list of strings.  It is also possible to exclude certain method from being run listing them in the ``exclude`` argument, if for some reason you don't want to regenerate certain properties.  

.. code-block:: python

	geom.regenerate()  # Calculate all properties
	geom.regenerate('pore_seed')  # Calculate only pore seed
	geom.regenerate('pore_seed',mode='exclude')  # Calculate all except pore_seed

===============================================================================
Applying Multiple Geometries to a Single Network
===============================================================================
A single **Network** can have a many different **Geometry** objects associated with it.  For instance a region of low permeability might be embedded in the middle of the domain, so the **Geometry** object for this region would calculate much smaller pore sizes.  In this case it is necessary to initialize each **Geometry** object with a list of which pores and throats it applies to.  Assuming that pores and throats for two domains have already been given labels of 'subdomain1' and 'subdomain2', the following procedure would generate two **Geometry** objects and apply them to the correct locations.  

.. code-block:: python

	pn = OpenPNM.Network.TestNet()  # This generates a 5x5x5 cubic network for testing purposes
	ps = pn.get_pore_indices(labels='subdomain1')
	ts = pn.get_throat_indicies(labels='subdomain1')
	geom1 = OpenPNM.Geometry.GenericNetwork(network=pn, name='geom_1',pores=ps,throats=ts)
	ps = pn.get_pore_indices(labels='subdomain2')
	ts = pn.get_throat_indicies(labels='subdomain2')
	geom2 = OpenPNM.Geometry.GenericNetwork(network=pn, name='geom_2',pores=ps,throats=ts)
	
There are a number of 'helper' methods available as well.  For instance, if the 'subdomain1' and 'subdomain2' labels have only been applied to pores, then it is necessary to apply labels to throats.  Finding which throats are only connected to one subdomain or the other can be done with:

.. code-block:: python

	ps = pn.get_pore_indices(labels='subdomain1')
	ts = pn.find_neighbor_throats(ps,mode='intersection')
